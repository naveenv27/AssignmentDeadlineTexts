One of the screenshots is a teacher who is registering himself as a CS2201 instructor and
then adding an assignment information and deadline. 
The other screenshot is a student requesting info from this class. He/she will see
whatever information the course instructor has added. 

If you ask for a course that is not registered then you will get an error message. 
If you enter in nothing after a command then you will be notified of this issue.
